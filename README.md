Collection of utility/helper scripts and addons. Basically whatever I like to use in Godot, am experimenting
with, and may or may not be in a usable and stable place to release as a standalone addon,
as well as my collection of utilities.

## Features

## The Future

I have a thought it might evolve into a plugin suite, but I don't have a clear vision for that yet.
Even though this is, at this point my own little playground, it is in several ways
built with the idea it could be that.

I might still split things out and make small self-contained plugins, but I also want a project I
can keep building on, now that I've used Godot for a long time and have gotten a pretty good idea
of how I like to use it. A codebase I can easily take around from project to project.
Maybe you like to use it like me and will find some of the same things useful!

### Project Goals

* Reduce boiler-plate code I find myself writing a lot
* Reduce code I've written once or twice and always need to look up how to do again
* Collect things I like that aren't game-specific
* Keep things modular... ish
	* Increasingly I want my utilities everywhere I go - that's the O2 autoload
	* [Variant Resources](addons/o2/addons/variant_resources) seems like a *game-changer*
		* I want to keep building systems on top of it, it's been soooo useful so far
* Make extending the editor easier
	* [PropertyInfoHelper](addons/o2/src/helpers/PropertyInfo.gd) has been a game-changer for this
